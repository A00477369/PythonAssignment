# Python Assignment

## Question 1
Python does not support stack or queue by default. However, you can wrap the existing
list and available functions to imitate these data structures. This exercise is limited to
concepts we have learned in the workshop so far but you want to look up how to handle
default arguments and how ‘None’ argument works. You will create two functions: 1.
stack and 2. queue. Both functions will have only two operations: add and remove.

## Question 2
This exercise is to practice applying a function to pandas dataframes. You will need to
write a function that counts the number of vowels in the given column. You can use the IMDb
dataset we used during the class.

## Question 3
You will need to create a Streamlit app that allows me to upload a CSV file with two
columns as follows:
| Name  | Age |
| ----- | --- |
| John  | 76  |
| Kumar | 54  |
| Zoey  | 51  |
If a valid file is uploaded, you need to plot a histogram of ages.
